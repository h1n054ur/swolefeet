<h1 align="center">Twilio CLI Manager (Swolefeet)</h1>

A Python-based wrapper around the Twilio SDK, built in just 3 days using AI helpers (OpenHands, Claude, ChatGPT). This functional CLI tool lets you search, purchase, release, and configure phone numbers; send and view messages; place and manage calls; and inspect your Twilio account—all from the terminal. Future plans include a GUI (web & desktop), a `pip`-installable package with full `argparse` support, and seamless command-line integration.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/swolefeet.git
   cd swolefeet
   ```

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🔑 Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file and set your Twilio credentials:  
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env`:
   ```ini
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
   ```

> ⚠️ The app will raise an error if `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` or `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` are missing.

---

## 💻 Usage

Launch the CLI from the project root:

```bash
python -m twilio_manager.cli.main
```

Or, once packaged in the future:

```bash
twilio-cli-manager --help
```

Follow on-screen prompts to navigate menus. For direct commands, you can also run (after adding entry-points):

```bash
twilio-manager search           # Search available numbers
twilio-manager purchase         # Purchase a phone number
twilio-manager send-message     # Send an SMS
twilio-manager make-call        # Place a voice call
```

*(Exact command names will be finalized when the package is published.)*

## 📝 Logging

All runtime logs (info, warnings, errors) are written to `logs/app.log` by default. Use this file for troubleshooting:

```bash
tail -f logs/app.log
```

---

## ✅ Testing

Run the full test suite with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/):

```bash
pytest
```

- `tests/` covers core functionality, services, and CLI menus.  
- `tests/requirements-test.txt` lists any additional test-specific dependencies.
